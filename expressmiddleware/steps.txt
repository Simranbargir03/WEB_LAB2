iddlewares in Express.js as per your experiment objectives, let's create a simple Node.js application using Express that incorporates two middleware functions: myLogger and requestTime. These middleware functions will showcase different aspects of middleware in Express.

Step-by-Step Example
Setting Up the Project:

Create a new folder named expressmiddleware.
Navigate to this folder in your terminal or command prompt.
Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init and follow the prompts to create a package.json file.
Install Express:

Install Express.js using npm:
Copy code
npm install express
Create index.js File:

Create a file named index.js in the expressmiddleware folder.
Implement Middleware Functions and Express App:

javascript
Copy code
// index.js

// Importing required modules
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function: myLogger
const myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('LOGGED');
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware function
};

// Middleware function: requestTime
const requestTime = function (req, res, next) {
  req.requestTime = Date.now(); // Adding requestTime property to req object
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware function
};

// Registering middlewares with Express app
app.use(myLogger);
app.use(requestTime);

// Route handler for GET request to '/'
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  let responseText = 'Hello World!<br>';
  responseText += `<small>Requested at: ${new Date(req.requestTime).toLocaleString()}</small>`;
  res.send(responseText);
});

// Route handler for POST request to '/'
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Received a POST request');
});

// Starting the server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
Explanation of Code:

Middleware Functions (myLogger and requestTime):
myLogger: This middleware simply logs 'LOGGED' to the console every time a request is made to the server. It then calls next() to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.
requestTime: This middleware adds a requestTime property to the req object with the current timestamp (in milliseconds since Unix epoch). It also calls next() to pass control to the next middleware.
Express App Setup:
app.use(myLogger);: Registers myLogger middleware globally for all routes.
app.use(requestTime);: Registers requestTime middleware globally for all routes.
app.get('/', ...) and app.post('/', ...): Defines route handlers for GET and POST requests to the root path (/). These handlers demonstrate how to use middleware-modified req properties (requestTime) in the route handler.
Route Handlers:
app.get('/', ...): Sends a response containing 'Hello World!' and displays the timestamp of the request using req.requestTime.
app.post('/', ...): Sends a simple response indicating that a POST request was received.
Testing with Postman:

Open Postman application.
Send GET and POST requests to http://localhost:3000.
Verify that the server responds correctly with the expected messages.
